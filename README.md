## Overview  
The War Field Spying Robot is designed to gather intelligence on enemy territory using sensors and cameras. It focuses on enhancing mobility, remote control, and real-time data transmission for surveillance purposes.

## Features  
- Remote control operation  
- Integrated camera and motion sensors  
- Wireless data transmission  
- Lightweight and compact design  

## Technologies Used  
- Robotics  
- Arduino  
- Embedded Systems  
- C and  C++ Programming  
- Camera and Motion Sensors  
- Wireless Communication  
## How It Works  
The robot uses an Arduino microcontroller to process sensor data and control movements. The camera and motion sensors capture data, which is then transmitted wirelessly to a remote receiver for real-time monitoring and surveillance.

## Setup and Installation  
1. Install the Arduino IDE on your computer.  
2. Connect the camera and motion sensors to the Arduino board as per the wiring diagram.  
3. Upload the provided Arduino code to the board.  
4. Set up the wireless communication module to connect with the remote receiver.  
5. Test the robot by controlling it remotely and monitoring sensor data.

## Usage  
Control the robot remotely using the wireless interface and monitor the live data feed from the sensors and camera to gather intelligence from the targeted area.

## Challenges & Learning  
During development, integrating multiple sensors and ensuring reliable wireless communication were key challenges. This project enhanced my skills in robotics, sensor integration, and real-time data processing.
