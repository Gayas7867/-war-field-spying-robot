# War Field Spying Robot

## Overview  
Before a military attack, officers need to gather intelligence about enemy positions to plan their strategy safely. The War Field Spying Robot is designed to do exactly that â€” it is a small, lightweight robot equipped with a camera and sensors that can be sent into the war field to spy and provide real-time video and data. This helps military forces detect enemy locations before starting a mission, improving safety and effectiveness.

## Features  
- Remote control movement  
- Small camera and motion sensors for real-time monitoring  
- Wireless data transmission to the command center  

## Technologies Used  
- Robotics  
- Arduino  
- Embedded Systems  
- C and C++ programming  
- Camera and Motion Sensors  
- Wireless Communication  

## How It Works  
The robot uses an Arduino microcontroller programmed in C/C++ to process data from motion sensors and the camera. It sends the live video and sensor data wirelessly to a remote command center, where military personnel can analyze the information and make informed decisions before engaging in the field.

## Setup  
1. Connect sensors and camera to the Arduino board.  
2. Upload the Arduino program to the board using Arduino IDE.  
3. Set up the wireless communication module for data transfer.  
4. Control the robot remotely and monitor the live data feed.

## Challenges & Learning  
Integrated multiple sensors and ensured stable wireless communication. Developed skills in embedded systems, robotics, and real-time data transmission under challenging conditions.
